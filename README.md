# Jekyll blog: Opinions and Curiosities
This is the repo for my personal blog - https://sidhin.in/blog. Hosted using github pages.

## How to build/ serve locally

1. Ensure you have jekyll and ruby dependencies [configured](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
2. Run the command - `bundle exec jekyll serve` from `blog/` folder.
